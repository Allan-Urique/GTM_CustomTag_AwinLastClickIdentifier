# Older versions
  - sha: 3e33a2d2704b752903dc06ff6bf76f9e30c61a49
    changeNotes: Added a feature for you to be able to use source trigger again, instead of all pages. If the advertiser uses a cookie consent pop-up that redirects to the website, it would cause the template to not work. If you disable the "Using All Page Trigger" checkbox now and use the source trigger instead. It should work correctly.

    changeNotes: The template is now simpler to use, just trigger it using an All Pages trigger and it will automatically decide how to proceed.

    changeNotes: Added the ability to use multiple Awin Source values. This way advertisers can have campaigns with multiple "utm_source" values for example, and the template will still record transactions correctly.
