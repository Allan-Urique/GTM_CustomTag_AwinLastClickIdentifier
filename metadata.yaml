  - sha: 3e33a2d2704b752903dc06ff6bf76f9e30c61a49
    changeNotes: Added a feature for you to be able to use source trigger again, instead of all pages. If the advertiser uses a cookie consent pop-up that redirects to the website, it would cause the template to not work. If you disable the "Using All Page Trigger" checkbox now and use the source trigger instead. It should work correctly.
