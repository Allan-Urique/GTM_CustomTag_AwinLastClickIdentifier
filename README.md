# Awin AW Last Click Identifier - Google Tag Manager
This tag is responsible for creating a cookie with the value "aw" if Awin was the Last Paid Click Referring Channel in the user journey, or "other" if it wasn't. This will feed the channel parameter.

# Features
Create a first-party cookie that will check if Awin was the Last Paid Click Referring Channel in the user's journey.

If desired and contract compliant, the tag can also make sure Organic traffic won't be measured as "Awin" even if Awin was the Last Paid Click Referring Channel.
